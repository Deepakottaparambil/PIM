# REST API to get Product Information
This is a small code to fetch the project details. It is basically done based on REST API
Controller as Product Controller with two actions
Api folder has all the REST files to getProductdetails, create ,insert, update and delete products, getBranddetails, getUserProducts which can be tested with POSTMAN.
Model folder contains all database related files
index.php calls ProductController

pim.sql file has the MySQL datadump which I used for this project
